# LINEbot-SJO

This is a LINE bot written in PHP for the Setagaya Junior Orchestra.

It grabs the messages posted in http://www.s-j-o.jp every 10 minutes, and posts it to the orchestra group LINE chat in a formatted embed.

Running this on your own requires a LINE token (and of course a bot), and a server that can run cronjobs on `cronjob.php`.

This LINE bot was extended from my Kokusai IB Bot, another LINE bot that I developed.
