# LINEbot-SJO

**NOTE**

  This bot no longer works because Setagaya Junior Orchestra has renewed their website following several months of downtime. As I am no longer a member of said orchestra, I do not have access to the new login credentials; thus I can not and will not fix the code for this bot to accommodate for the website changes.

This is a LINE bot written in PHP for the Setagaya Junior Orchestra.

It grabs the messages posted in http://www.s-j-o.jp every 10 minutes, and posts it to the orchestra group LINE chat in a formatted embed.

Running this on your own requires a LINE token (and of course a bot), and a server that can run cronjobs on `cronjob.php`.

This LINE bot was extended from my Kokusai IB Bot, another LINE bot that I developed.
